# hello-world
Dear Sir's, ladies and gentlemans, aliens and others that I don't know about at this moment in time

Jarl-Inge alias ZeBoss here.

I'm a noob here at GidHib but speeding up on this cyber service. My main entry point was through Sublime-app and the add-on's feature within.

I'm a electro technician, engineer within industrial automation and have a master of scients in process automation. Done coding in real time control systems for oil & gas, offshore facilities like floaters, semi's, subsea, construction vessels, onshore facilities like production plants and so on.

At the moment playing with visual basics coding vba within Microsoft Excel for Mac. Yes I have converted to macOS and finally found me home spot. Still learning the AppleScript stuff and love the movments within smart home's.

If there are questions of any kind, please don't hessitate to take contact.
